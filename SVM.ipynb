    "\n",
    "The SVM algorithm is implemented in practice using a kernel. \n",
    "A kernel transforms an input data space into the required form. SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick. \n",
    "Here, the kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. \n",
    "In other words,you can say that it converts nonseparable problem to separable problems by adding more dimension to it.\n",
    "It is most useful in non-linear separation problem. Kernel trick helps you to build a more accurate classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Kernel A linear kernel can be used as normal dot product any two given observations. \n",
    "The product between two vectors is the sum of the multiplication of each pair of input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "K(x, xi) = sum(x * xi)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Kernel A polynomial kernel is a more generalized form of the linear kernel. \n",
    "The polynomial kernel can distinguish curved or nonlinear input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "K(x,xi) = 1 + sum(x * xi)^d\n",
    "\n",
    "Where d is the degree of the polynomial. d=1 is similar to the linear transformation. \n",
    "The degree needs to be manually specified in the learning algorithm.\n",

    "Radial Basis Function Kernel \n",
    "\n",
    "The Radial basis function kernel is a popular kernel function commonly used in support vector machine classification. \n",
    "RBF can map an input space in infinite dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "K(x,xi) = exp(-gamma * sum((x â€“ xi^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Here gamma is a parameter, which ranges from 0 to 1. \n",
    "A higher value of gamma will perfectly fit the training dataset, which causes over-fitting. \n",
    "Gamma=0.1 is considered to be a good default value. \n",
    "The value of gamma needs to be manually specified in the learning algorithm.\n",
